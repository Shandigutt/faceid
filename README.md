FaceID is an open source project funded from the National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.ac.lk/) and developed through the University of Colombo School of computing (http://www.ucsc.cmb.ac.lk/) which introduces a novel facial muscles anatomy based approach for forensic facial reconstruction for the local officials. 


Background of the "Forencic Facial Reconstruction"
=====

Forensic facial reconstruction is the process by which facial approximations are generated by using
the skeletal remains of the deceased and the accuracy of which is widely debated topic since it is
easily the most subjective as well as one of the most controversial techniques in the field of forensic
anthropology. But a considerable number of researches have established that this procedure is
effective to generate approximations in order to identify a disfigured corpse and it is being used
extensively in the more developed countries in forensic cases.
